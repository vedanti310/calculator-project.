# Calculator Project

## Description
This project is a simple calculator implemented in Python. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, it includes a function to find the largest of three numbers. This code is designed to be easy to use and can serve as a foundation for more complex mathematical applications.

## Features
- Addition of two numbers
- Subtraction of two numbers
- Multiplication of two numbers
- Division of two numbers with error handling for division by zero
- Finding the largest among three numbers

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, if using the .ipynb file)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd calculator-project
   ```
3. (Optional) If using a virtual environment, create and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install any required dependencies (if applicable).

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook calculator.ipynb
   ```
   or run the Python script directly:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```
2. Follow the examples in the code to perform operations. You can modify the inputs in the functions to test different scenarios.

### Example
```python
from calculator import add, subtract, multiply, divide, find_largest

# Basic Operations
print("Addition:", add(5, 3))
print("Subtraction:", subtract(5, 3))
print("Multiplication:", multiply(5, 3))

# Division with error handling
try:
    print("Division:", divide(5, 0))
except ValueError as e:
    print("Error:", e)

# Find the largest number
print("Largest number:", find_largest(5, 10, 3))
```

## Project Structure
- `calculator.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file containing the calculator code.
- `calculator.py`: Python script with the same functionality as the notebook (optional).
